------- Elevator Management System -------

**Overview:**
This is a simplified simulation of an elevator control system for a building. The application manages multiple elevators, processes user requests, and calculates the time for elevators to handle these requests. It is designed to be efficient and modular, focusing on basic elevator movement and request handling.

**Features**
1. Supports multiple elevators and floors.
2. Simulates elevator movement and stop times.
3. Handles direction-based requests (up/down).
4. Assigns requests to the most suitable elevator based on position, direction, and current targets.
5. Calculates time dynamically, taking into account travel and stop times.

**How to Run**
1. Clone the repository or copy the source code.
2. Open the project in your C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Build and run the project.
4. Observe the simulation in the console as elevators handle requests dynamically.
